# Variables in Python

- Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program
- A variable is created by assigning a name to a value using (=)
- The variable name is then used to access the value it holds
- Variables can hold many data types: intergers, strings and booleans
    ## Example 1: Creating and assigning values to variables
        my_height = 100
        my_name = "James Holden"
    ## Example 2: Using variables
        x = 5
        y = 10
        sum = x + y
        print(sum)  # Output: 15

  # Basic veriable types

- Python suppourts several basic data types
  ## Strings: a sequence of characters and can be declared using double quotes (or single)  
    ## Example:
        name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev'
        name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev"
  ## Integers: whole numbers without a decimal point and can be positive or negative
    ## Example:
        x = 5
        y = -5
  ## Floats: numbers with a decimal point, they can also be positive or negative
    ## Example:
        x = 5.2
        y = -5.2
  ## Booleans: one of two values, True or False. Used for logical operations and conditions
    ## Example:
        is_tall = True
        is_short = False
