# Functions in Python

Functions encapsulate reusable logic.

Defined with def, followed by the function name and parameters.

Use return to send back a result.

    def area_of_circle(r):
        pi = 3.14
        return pi * r * r

    print(area_of_circle(5))   # 78.5
    print(area_of_circle(10))  # 314.0

Functions help organize code and avoid repetition.
