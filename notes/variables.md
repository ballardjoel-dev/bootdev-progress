# Variables in Python

- Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program
- A variable is created by assigning a name to a value using (=)
- The variable name is then used to access the value it holds
- Variables can hold many data types: intergers, strings and booleans
    ## Example 1: Creating and assigning values to variables
        my_height = 100
        my_name = "James Holden"
    ## Example 2: Using variables
        x = 5
        y = 10
        sum = x + y
        print(sum)  # Output: 15
