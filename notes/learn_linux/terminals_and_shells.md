# Terminals and Shells

## Terminals vs. GUI (CLI vs. GUI)
A CLI (Command Line Interface) lets users interact with the system using text commands, offering speed, automation, and precision—especially for repetitive or complex tasks. A GUI (Graphical User Interface) uses visual elements like windows and icons, which are more beginner-friendly but less efficient for scripting and automation.

### Example:

    echo "Hello world"
    # Outputs: Hello world

## What is a Shell

A shell is a command-line program that reads, evaluates, and executes user input—often described as a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It serves as a bridge between the user and the operating system, letting you run commands, manage files, and control system processes.

### Examples of Shells:

- bash (common on Linux)
- zsh (popular alternative to bash)
- PowerShell (primarily used on Windows)
