# Comments

- Comments are annotations in the code set by the developer
- Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
- They help programmers understand the code by providing context or explanations
- There are 2 types of comments:
  - Single line comments: starting with a (#) and extend to the end of the line
  - Multi line comments: also known as docstrings, are enclosed within triple quotes (""")
    ## Example 1: Single-line comments
        # This is a single-line comment
        name = "Boots"  # This is an in-line comment
    ## Example 2: Multi-line comments
        """
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
        """
        print("Pythogoras was here")
