## Learn to Code in Python notes










# Comments

- Comments are annotations in the code set by the developer
- Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
- They help programmers understand the code by providing context or explanations
- There are 2 types of comments:
  - Single line comments: starting with a (#) and extend to the end of the line
  - Multi line comments: also known as docstrings, are enclosed within triple quotes (""")
    - Example 1: Single-line comments
        # This is a single-line comment
        name = "Boots"  # This is an in-line comment
    - Example 2: Multi-line comments
        """
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
        """
        print("Pythogoras was here")

# F-strings

- F-strings provide a concise and readable way to include variables within strings
- An (f) before the string denotes an f-string
- Any expression within curly brackets {} is evaluated and interpolated into the string
    - Example 1: Basic use of an f-string
        name = "Thrall"
        age = 28
        print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
        # Thrall is 28 years old.
    - Example 2: Incorporating expressions
        a = 5
        b = 10
        print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {a + b}.")
        # The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.

# NoneType Variables
