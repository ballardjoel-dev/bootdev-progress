## Learn to Code in Python notes

# What is Python

- Python is a popular programming language
- It is known for its readability and simplicity
- It is widely used in many domains including 
  - Web development
  - Data analysis
  - Artificial intelligence
  - Scientific computing
- Pythons syntax is intuitive and mirrors natural language

# Syntax Errors in Python

- Syntax refers to the set of rules in a programming language
- Syntax errors occur when the code deviates from these rules
- A common example is incorrect indentation
- A syntax error in Python is indicated by an error message and points to the line where the error was detected
    - Example 1: Mismatched quotes
        # Incorrect
        print("hello world')
        # Correct
        print("hello world")
    - Example 2: Missing parenthesis
        # Incorrect
        print("hello world"
        # Correct
        print("hello world")

# Variables in Python

- Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program
- A variable is created by assigning a name to a value using (=)
- The variable name is then used to access the value it holds
- Variables can hold many data types: intergers, strings and booleans
    - Example 1: Creating and assigning values to variables
        my_height = 100
        my_name = "James Holden"
    - Example 2: Using variables
        x = 5
        y = 10
        sum = x + y
        print(sum)  # Output: 15

# Mathmatical Operators

- Mathmatical operations can be performed using arithmetic operators
- Operators: (+) addition, (-) subtraction, (*) multiplication, (/) division
- Operators can be used to perform calculations and store the results
- Parentheses can be used to order math operations
    - Example 1: Basic arithmetic
        a = 10
        b = 5
        summation = a + b  # Addition
        difference = a - b # Subtraction
        product = a * b    # Multiplication
        quotient = a / b   # Division
        print(summation)   # 15
        print(difference)  # 5
        print(product)     # 50
        print(quotient)    # 2.0 (note that division returns a float)
    - Example 2: Using parentheses
        a = 5
        b = 7
        c = 9
        avg = (a + b + c) / 3
        print(avg) # 7.0

# Negative Numbers

- Negative numbers are created by placing a (-) sign in front of the integer
- This syntax indicates that a value is less than 0
    - Example: Assigning a negative number to a variable
        debt = -500
        balance = 1000
        net_worth = balance + debt
        print(net_worth)
        # 500

# Comments

- Comments are annotations in the code set by the developer
- Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter
- They help programmers understand the code by providing context or explanations
- There are 2 types of comments:
  - Single line comments: starting with a (#) and extend to the end of the line
  - Multi line comments: also known as docstrings, are enclosed within triple quotes (""")
    - Example 1: Single-line comments
        # This is a single-line comment
        name = "Boots"  # This is an in-line comment
    - Example 2: Multi-line comments
        """
        This is a multi-line comment.
        It can span multiple lines.
        """
        print("Pythogoras was here")
