# Mathmatical Operators

- Mathmatical operations can be performed using arithmetic operators
- Operators: (+) addition, (-) subtraction, (*) multiplication, (/) division
- Operators can be used to perform calculations and store the results
- Parentheses can be used to order math operations
    ## Example 1: Basic arithmetic
        a = 10
        b = 5
  
        summation = a + b  # Addition
        difference = a - b # Subtraction
        product = a * b    # Multiplication
        quotient = a / b   # Division
  
        print(summation)   # 15
        print(difference)  # 5
        print(product)     # 50
        print(quotient)    # 2.0 (note that division returns a float)
    ## Example 2: Using parentheses
        a = 5
        b = 7
        c = 9
  
        avg = (a + b + c) / 3
        print(avg) # 7.0
