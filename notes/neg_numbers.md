# Negative Numbers

- Negative numbers are created by placing a (-) sign in front of the integer
- This syntax indicates that a value is less than 0
    ## Example: Assigning a negative number to a variable
        debt = -500
        balance = 1000
        net_worth = balance + debt
        print(net_worth)
        # 500
